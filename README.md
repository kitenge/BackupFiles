# BackupFiles

## About

This is a personal project developed in Delphi, aimed at automating routine backup tasks. It uses SQLite for database management, follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and is designed with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to ensure clean and maintainable code.

The software allows for backups to be saved locally or uploaded to an FTP server, and it offers the flexibility to maintain a specified number of backup copies. This project is my attempt to create a practical tool for managing data backups efficiently while applying best practices in software development.

## Key Features

- Automated backup routines
- Local and FTP server storage options
- Limit on the number of backup copies to save space
- Developed using Delphi with SQLite, following OOP and MVC principles
- Emphasis on clean code for easy maintenance and readability

## Personal Project

This backup solution is a personal project, reflecting my journey in exploring advanced programming concepts and applying them to real-world challenges. It is an open invitation for anyone interested in backup automation, Delphi programming, or software architecture to explore, learn, and contribute.
